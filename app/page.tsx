        {`I am a data analyst studying computer science at Wilfrid Laurier University mastering Python, 
        SQL, R, and Power BI. As I try to better understand the world around us through data, engineering, 
        and statistics I also love to get pulled into the worlds of history and economics. While I am 
        learning how to apply my skills to the insurance industry, I would love to have a chat about your 
        journey, and how my skills could impact your business make more efficient processes, and better 
        decision making.`}
